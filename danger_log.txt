After creating a new app
    - import required models in urls.py and views.py
    - add app config to settings.py-installed_apps
    - add urls to urls.py in the main project

Remember to amend allowed hosts in settings.py to include the domain name

Amend datebase info in settings.py everytime when using different computers

collectstatic after changing static files(python manage.py collectstatic)

modify boostrap address after copying bootstrap files to templates

Use appname:urlname to link to other pages in different app

HTML form pitfall: input must have 'name' - otherwise after submit there won't 
be any payload data. some template curiously don't have 'name' in <input>
